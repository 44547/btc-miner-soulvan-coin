⚙️ Technical Architecture
• 	Cross‑Platform CLI Tooling
A miner orchestrated like your other Soulvan modules: modular CLI, dependency‑aware configs, auto‑update agents across Windows, macOS, Linux.
• 	GPU/ASIC Abstraction Layer
Detects hardware (NVIDIA, AMD, ASIC rigs) and optimizes mining algorithms (SHA‑256) with contributor‑friendly presets.
• 	Contributor KPI Exporters
Mining stats (hashrate, shares, rewards) exported into Grafana dashboards alongside SoulvanMusic and SoulvanRacing KPIs.
• 	Wallet Identity Integration
Mining rewards tied to Soulvan’s wallet identity system — provenance anchored, remix DNA tracked, DAO voting hooks for reward distribution.

🎭 Mythic Layer
• 	Cinematic Onboarding
Contributors launch the miner through a “SoulvanArrival” sequence — their rig becomes part of the mythic fleet.
• 	Prestige Ceremonies
Mining milestones (first block found, hashpower thresholds) celebrated with cinematic boss‑style encounters and contributor ceremonies.
• 	DAO Governance
Contributors vote on mining pool parameters, reward splits, and personalization upgrades using Soulvan’s DAO smart contracts.

🌍 Global Inclusion
• 	Lightweight Mode
For contributors without ASICs, a “Soulvan BTC Lite Miner” could simulate mining while still earning prestige points in the ecosystem.
• 	Energy Transparency
Real‑time dashboards showing energy use, carbon footprint, and contributor impact — aligning with Soulvan’s ethos of clarity and fairness. 🛠 Soulvan BTC Miner – Prototype CLI Flow
1. Installation & Launch

• 	 triggers the cinematic SoulvanArrival sequence, visually onboarding the contributor’s rig into the mythic fleet.

2. Configuration

• 	Pool: Soulvan’s contributor‑powered pool.
• 	Wallet: Anchored to Soulvan’s photo‑based identity system.
• 	KPI Export: Streams mining stats into Grafana dashboards alongside SoulvanMusic and SoulvanRacing metrics.

3. Runtime Commands

• 	 overlays mythic boss encounters when milestones are hit (e.g., first block, hashpower thresholds).
• 	Status shows hashrate, shares, rewards, energy footprint, and prestige points.

4. DAO Governance Hooks

• 	Contributors directly shape mining pool rules, reward distribution, and personalization upgrades.

5. Prestige & Ceremonies
• 	Milestone Unlocks:
• 	First block → cinematic cutscene.
• 	1 TH/s sustained → contributor ceremony.
• 	SoulvanMusic Tie‑In: Mining rigs generate beats tied to hashrate, blending BTC mining with music AI.
